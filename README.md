# What is this... "project"?

This is short, fast and "easy" project where we can se how Modal Window works and how can we make it up with Javascrip.

This is my second project and I'm still at the very beggining, and learning how to develop web apps with javascript, html and css... step by step cause none of us was born knowing these things.

To can see it working you can clone the repository or download the zip file and open the index file with your favorite web browser or, execute it through live server of you IDE.

Thank you very much!!
