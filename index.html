        In user interface design, a modal window is a graphical control element
        that appears in front of an application's main window. It creates a mode
        that disables interaction with the main window until the modal window is
        closed. Think of it like a pop-up window that demands your attention.
        You typically have to interact with it in some way before you can go
        back to what you were doing.
